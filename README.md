## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The main problem we are trying to solve with this extention is to block adult content and let the youth focus on real goals of life.
Today India stands number 1 on watching adult content/movies this is a result of adapting western culture. This is the biggest threat to our country as a contry is built by its youth and if its youth is misguided and not on right track this can result to a bad future. We aim to resolve thier habbit and instead redirect them to a better website and show them what other productive things they can do.
To be straight on point we can also see that masturbation can result to fatigue,weakness,vision changes and many more. This is a big threat which stands ahead of todays youth of India.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

So the solution is quite simple any user will try to watch adult content generally by browser and if we directly put on an extension on browser every time user wishes to visit such website they will be redirected to a productive and motivating website. Its like stopping an addiction. We will turn out to be the best friend and a true caring friend for health and career purposes.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

Dependencies as such don't include much it will just need a browser to be load into. User will himself select it as an extention and will activate for his/her benifit. 
Limitation may incklude that if a website is not in our block list the website may open but we can solve it easily by raising an issue.Also vpn and proxy might not work as we have directly put extention on browser level so it would quite hard to break into but end of the it all depends on persons choices.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In future we plan to build a whole website and attach to the extention so we can generate reports for particular users and make them show how much they controlled thier urge and how they came out of the addiction.This would provide a better user experience.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

For now to get started you just need to cloan the repo
````
git clone https://github.com/crysosancher/parental-help.git

````
Thats it and then in extention section of your browser load the extention by selecting the cloned folder.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The usage is simple you just need to turn the extention on and that's it.
It will track if the website is in the black list or not if its there it will directly redirect with a notification.
