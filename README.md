## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
  
The main problem we are trying to solve with this extention is to block adult content and let the youth focus on real goals of life.
Today India stands number 1 on watching adult content/movies this is a result of adapting western culture. This is the biggest threat to our country as a contry is built by its youth and if its youth is misguided and not on right track this can result to a bad future. We aim to resolve thier habbit and instead redirect them to a better website and show them what other productive things they can do.

- Acording to [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23030090) around 37% of internet is full of pornographic content.
- Around 35% of all internet downloads are pornographic.
- As stated by [TOI](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/survey-70-of-boys-began-watching-porn-at-10-years/articleshow/48209402.cms) 70% of boys began watching porn at 10 years.
- As stated in section 292 of the IPC exclusively dealt with sale, distribution, public exhibition or circulation of any obscene book, drawing, painting, etc.(Still People can access it through virtual Private Network)
- In the report of WHO, masturbation could result to fatigue,weakness,vision changes and many more. This is a big threat which stands ahead of todays youth of India.
- People addicted to porn spend at least 11 to 12 hours per week viewing porn.
- Many conditions co-occur with porn addiction, including anxiety, depression, sex addiction, social anxiety and substance use disorders.


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
<!-- So the soloution is quite simple yet very effective,as indian govenrmnet has also tried to stop these porn websites but still it could be reached by using virtual private networks here we come in game nd we are trying to stop this addiction at browser level .  
This soloution doesnt not only stop you but also provide an alternative idea to be prodictive. -->
<!-- So the solution is quite simple any user will try to watch adult content generally by browser and if we directly put on an extension on browser every time user wishes to visit such website they will be redirected to a productive and motivating website.Its like stopping an addiction. We will turn out to be the best friend and a true caring friend for health and career purposes. -->
This extension will help you block all porn related content, no matter what method you use , and we'll also provide you with Useful article's and informative videos in case you try to search for Adult content.
Please do give it a try and we believe you can do it, just keep trying and don't lose hope.We will turn out to be the best friend and a true caring friend for health and career purposes.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

Dependencies as such don't include much it will just need a browser to be load into. User will himself select it as an extention and will activate for his/her benifit. 
Limitation may incklude that if a website is not in our block list the website may open but we can solve it easily by raising an issue.Also vpn and proxy might not work as we have directly put extention on browser level so it would quite hard to break into but end of the it all depends on persons choices.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In future we plan to build a whole website and attach to the extention so we can generate reports for particular users and make them show how much they controlled thier urge and how they came out of the addiction.This would provide a better user experience.

## üëΩ What we Provide:- <a name = "What_we_Provide"></a>
 - We take care of Vpn/Proxies or any third party tools.
 - We don't only block the problems but also provide a perfect solution for it.
 - We have taken care of more than 16k+ websites.And will keep on updating it.
 - This code is based on latest Manifest version (V3),which has not been yet adapted by most of the extensions.
